# flatEnigmaMachine
A python app based on Kevin's enigma machine found [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKbP3Rjxhy0) 
After seeing this machine at work in one of my security engineering courses, I decided to see how hard it would be to code.  
Turns out, its not that bad!

## Getting Started
To run this app ensure that you
- have python installed and that environment values have been set to allow you turn python from a command line  
- have a shell that you can run it from  

Thats it!

## Usage
To run it simply do;  

```
python enigma.py
```

or

```
python3 enigma.py
```

and follow the prompts. 

Ensure that all text requirements are met as error handling is not supported yet (the app has been very quickly put together).
